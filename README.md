# ProyectoEgg-Que-Sale-
final project of Fullstack jr Dev. course.

A website intended to promote local artists, fairs or any cultural event.

The main idea is that users will be able to access events near their location, 
go to the profile of the artists/venue/organizer not only to get a peak of what the 
event is about (by external links, as: YouTube, SounCloud, Spotify, Instagram, etc).

How many times we saw a flyer and wondered -who is that!?- or -I wonder what they do-
this will let the user and the audience decide if it fits what they like. 
Thus choosing to go or not, instead of the "I don`t know who they are, so... I wont go"

Technologies used in this project:

Java
Spring Boot
