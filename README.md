<h2>final project of Fullstack jr Dev. course.</h2>

A website intended to promote local artists, fairs or any cultural event.

The main idea is that users will be able to access events near their location, 
go to the profile of the artists, venue, or organizer who created the event. Getting a peak of what the 
event is about by external links as: YouTube, SoundCloud, Spotify, Instagram, etc.

How many times we saw a flyer and wondered <i>-"who is that!?"-</i> or <i>-"I wonder what they do"-</i>
this will let the user and the audience decide if it fits what they like, what the're into. 
Thus choosing to go or not, instead of the <i>-"I don`t know who they are, so... I wont go"-</i>

This will generate cultural movements.
